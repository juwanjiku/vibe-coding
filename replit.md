# Replit Coding Agent Guide

## Overview

This appears to be a new or empty repository with no existing codebase. The repository structure and architectural decisions are yet to be defined. This document will be updated as the project evolves and architectural decisions are made.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

**Current State:** No architecture has been defined yet.

**Key Decisions to be Made:**
- Frontend framework and structure
- Backend framework and API design
- Database choice and schema design
- Authentication and authorization approach
- Deployment and hosting strategy

As architectural decisions are made during development, they should be documented here with:
1. The problem or requirement being addressed
2. The chosen solution
3. Why this solution was selected
4. Trade-offs and considerations

## External Dependencies

**Current State:** No external dependencies have been added yet.

**Potential Integrations to Consider:**
- Database systems (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- Authentication services (Auth0, Firebase Auth, custom JWT, etc.)
- Cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, etc.)
- Third-party APIs (payment processing, email services, etc.)
- Monitoring and analytics tools

As external dependencies are added, document:
- Service name and purpose
- Integration approach
- Configuration requirements
- API keys or credentials needed (store securely, never commit)
